title: MArine Bioprospecting PATent (MABPAT) dataset
description_html: |
  <p>The goal of the MABPAT dataset is to provide a useful insight into the scope and scale of marine bioprospecting. We offer the research and practitioner community direct access to marine genetic sequences submitted to patent bureaus, their potential to encode biological functions, species taxonomy, type of applicant, and other information that might be relevant for the discussion on the access and utilization of marine genetic resources</p>
